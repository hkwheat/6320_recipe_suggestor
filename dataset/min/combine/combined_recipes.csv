The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use   whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or   your conscience) dictates. Certainly if anyone were to insist that   'Maultaschen' were the most delicious of all Swabian   specialties, I[rst Scharfenberg] would hardly be   prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier, I   suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good   chances in a four-way international competition with   ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the champion- ship   of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus   Miscellaneous) Filling division.",character(0),Lunch/Snacks,"c(""Pork"", ""Meat"", ""German"", ""European"", ""< 15 Mins"", ""Stove Top"")","c(""2 3/4"", ""4"", NA, ""1"", ""6"", ""3"", ""1/4"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1"", ""3"", ""3"", NA, NA, ""1"", ""3"")","c(""flour"", ""eggs"", ""salt"", ""butter"", ""bacon"", ""onions"", ""sausage"", ""spinach"", ""Farmer's sausage"", ""eggs"", ""parsley"", ""salt"", ""pepper"", ""egg"", ""milk"")",4.0,2.0,723.2,28.1,10.1,405.9,660.4,85.1,5.4,4.6,30.7,4.0,,"c(""Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to   make a pasta dough."", ""Then add a little water and knead   until it has a firm but elastic consistency."", ""To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and   fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite   translucent.

I was so glad when I found it again as only a few even came close in taste and texture.
