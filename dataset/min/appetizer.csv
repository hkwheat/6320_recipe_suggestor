The following recipe is typical but far   from definitive, especially where the ingredients   for the filling are concerned.  Feel free to use   whatever you have on hand or whatever your fancy (or   your conscience) dictates. Certainly if anyone were to insist that   'Maultaschen' were the most delicious of all Swabian   specialties, I[rst Scharfenberg] would hardly be   prepared to deny it.  In fact, as indicated earlier, I   suspect that 'Maultaschen' would have very good   chances in a four-way international competition with   ravioli, won tons, and pirogi for the champion- ship   of the Roughly Rectangular Pasta with Meat (plus   Miscellaneous) Filling division.",character(0),Lunch/Snacks,"c(""Pork"", ""Meat"", ""German"", ""European"", ""< 15 Mins"", ""Stove Top"")","c(""2 3/4"", ""4"", NA, ""1"", ""6"", ""3"", ""1/4"", ""1"", ""1/2"", ""1/2"", ""1"", ""3"", ""3"", NA, NA, ""1"", ""3"")","c(""flour"", ""eggs"", ""salt"", ""butter"", ""bacon"", ""onions"", ""sausage"", ""spinach"", ""Farmer's sausage"", ""eggs"", ""parsley"", ""salt"", ""pepper"", ""egg"", ""milk"")",4.0,2.0,723.2,28.1,10.1,405.9,660.4,85.1,5.4,4.6,30.7,4.0,,"c(""Combine the flour, eggs, and salt in a bowl and mix to   make a pasta dough."", ""Then add a little water and knead   until it has a firm but elastic consistency."", ""To make the filling, melt the butter in a skillet and   fry the bacon with the onions until both are quite   translucent.

What they think is a Philly Cheese Steak involves green peppers and onions.  So if thats what you are looking for, then no dice.

You need him to partially freeze a hunk of Rib Eye, and then slice it very thin.  You want it sliced thin even though common sense tells us that thick is better.  You can buy the hunk of rib eye and freeze and slice it yourself, but the butcher generally does a better job than I do.  I can only get it about 1/8\"" thick and he does about."", ""BREAD:  This is the hard part.  If you aren't in the tristate area, and can't get AMOROSOS rolls (the only thing that is REALLY good on a cheesesteak) then you  have to find a substitute.  Squishy sub rolls will NOT do.  They do not hold together under pressure.  Refrain from buying those \""hero\"" rolls too.  A good hoagie roll is almost rubbery in texture, but quite soft.  The best substitute I have found is a loaf of French bread. Not as good as the real thing, but hey, beggars can't be choosers."",

Saute toppings until pliable - make them however you like them.  Remove them from pan and set aside."", ""Pour some more oil in the pan (I use olive oil, but if you have access to the stuff they use in restaurants on grills it would taste even better) on medium high heat.  Place 1/4 to 1/3 of a pound of meat in the pan, lying the pieces flat and overlapping to form a shape that will fit nicely in a bun."", 
""When the meat turns grey with doneness, flip it over and if you are using cheese slices now is the time to lie them on top of the meat.  Add the other toppings back into the pan next to the meat and allow to reheat.  Cover the pan to allow the cheese to melt.  This should take 1-2 minutes.  If the meat looks overcooked, thats ok - i t should be GRAY."", ""This is the time to toast the bread if you so wish.  I don't like mine toasted at all.  Warmed is ok."", ""If you are using cheese whiz, warm it in the microwave. Pick up meat and melted cheese with a spatula and deposit on the roll.  IF using cheese whiz, use a butter knife or chopstick to smear whiz next to the meat."",
