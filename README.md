**Authors:** Meet Patel, Haley Wheatley, Reg Gonzalez, Dat Nguyen <br>
**Course:** CS 6320.002 (Natural Language Processing)

### Project Description:
The goal of the project is to develop a suggestion system that uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand a user's input and suggest recipes for them. We've classified recipes into the following categories: appetizers, breakfast, lunch, dinner, or dessert. If the user's input is unclear, then it will suggest a recipe based on the current time of day. Additionally, a user profile will be created that keeps track of their likes and dislikes; this will be taken into account when the system suggests new recipes. 

### Project Scope:
1. Filter recipes based on meal types (i.e., appetizer, breakfast, lunch, dinner, dessert)
2. Use NLP to understand user input and put them into appropriate category meal types
3. Create a default mechanism for suggesting recipes based on the time of day
4. Create a user profile that keeps track of their likes and dislikes
5. Implement a weight preferences system to make the recipe suggestions more personalized for the user
6. Testing/debugging
